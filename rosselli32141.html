                    The residents of Los Angeles are called Angelenos. Their lifestyle relies on the automobile,
                idealizes the single-family dwelling, and favours informality. With notable exceptions, the skyline is primarily
                horizontal rather than vertical. Los Angeles is a place of extraordinary ethnic and racial diversity,
                owing largely to immigration. It is a must visit place and a beautiful vacation desination.
